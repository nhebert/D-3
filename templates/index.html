                <p>So what are some of the eye-catching associations? An inverse association between the household income and
                    smoking was something I didn't expect (you may click the Household Income title text on the x-axis).
                    The state of Utah doesn't seem to fit well with the model though. Another association I saw was between age dependency and alcohol consumption (if we exclude the state of DC, this relationship will become more apparent). If we for a moment forget the popular statement in statistics that correlation does not imply
                    causation, we can probably say that people become sober when they are dealt with more responsibilities.
                    We also can see an inverse association between poverty and being physically active.</p>

                    <p> It is also interesting to see how the state of Puerto Rico is getting clustered-out from the inland states
                        in North America in most of the indicators!</p>


                    <p>This is my first D3 based data visualization. I would like to thank Scott Murray for his amazing book:
                        Interactive Data Visualization for the Web, and Jeremy Hill at UT Austin for the inspiration and guidance.
